    # ── Phase 1 Overall ──

    summary: |
      Engine module is architecturally sound with strong bio-inspired design.
      Main concerns: N+1 DB queries in consolidation, Union-Find duplication,
      division-by-zero edge cases, and ReflexPipeline.query() god-function.
      Security is excellent (A-). Code quality is clean (A).

    priority_fixes:
      - "CRITICAL: Fix N+1 bridge detection in consolidation._prune()"
      - "HIGH: Guard division-by-zero in _predicates_conflict() and _merge() Jaccard"
      - "HIGH: Delete dead reconstitute_answer() in retrieval_context.py"
      - "HIGH: Extract shared UnionFind utility (eliminate 120 lines duplication)"
      - "HIGH: Add find_neurons_batch() for anchor finding"
      - "MEDIUM: Use replace() instead of manual frozen dataclass construction"
      - "MEDIUM: Fix lateral inhibition slot distribution"
